    title: '5 years in social projects',
    content: `At the age of 21 I got involved in my first social educational project which was a period of much learning and understanding of what motivates me professionally and personally. 
    I acted as a Mathematics and Physics tutor, Physics teacher, HR coordinator and Director during my stay in this first project. As an introvert myself, much courage of me was required to face a loooot of public speaking (one of my greatest fears). BUT my greatest challenged was the quest on how to engage 50 students in the same room aged between 16 and 60 years old to learn 'Principle of Inertia' on a Friday at 10 pm. 

    Leading a team of 20 teachers and 5 coordinators made me gain perspective and ability to listen, guide and delegate. 
    My team managed to initiate an important partnerships of book donations and concessions of spaces for classes, study rooms and equipments. As well as establish an internal selection process for teachers, tutors and students, thus needing to interview numerous volunteers and students.`

    content: `For 4 and a half years I was an employee of a private school in Brazil and during my time there I worked on several fronts. I started as an tutor in math and physics for students aged between 11 and 18. My main activities were to
    help students with their specific difficulties in math and physics, assist science projects, and teach extra-classes. For two years I was an assistant teacher for newly literate students (between 6 and 8 years old). And that was my first experience working with children which was extremely challenging for me. My main activities consisted of: Attend classes and assist students and teachers on their assignments; Being responsible for teaching Portuguese and Mathematics extra classes; The following year, I was invited to be part of the high school coordinators team as an assistant, this was a totally new category at school and I helped to develop what was part of the tasks for this new front at school.I got involved in activities such as: Assist coordinators on job interviews; Pedagogic meetings with students, teachers, parents, pedagogic coordinators and school principal; Giving creative input to students on their Science projects and on their participations on Innovation and Science fairs - ‚ÄúQuanta - INDIA‚Äù; I was mentor of students during science fair ‚Äú22a Ci√™ncia Jovem‚Äù in Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil and mentor of students during field studies in Bel√©m, Par√°, Brazil. In 2017 a new lab was created in this school - a Maker Space. I was invited to be part of the team that helped elaborate the concept of this new asset in school. We got equipments such as 3D printer, laser cutter, printer and cutter plotter, woodwork, electronics devices and textile handcrafting and I received training on how to work with all new material and I helped teacher of all subjects on how they could work with their students in this new environment.`

    title: 'Educational path',
    content: `I have always been passionate about science and have been very involved with subjects such as Physics and Mathematics during my school years. My curiosity and interest in education, the arts and social justice, however, have always been themes of great relevance in my life.

    My biggest conflict was and is choosing a career that catered to so many areas of interest to me.
    
    At the age of 19 I was accepted for Civil Engineering at the University of S√£o Paulo. It was a very focused and intense study period, my highlight among all the mandatory courses I had to attend was definitely the C++ programming course in my first semester.
    
    Due to some health problems, I had periods of absence from college and work, which made me reflect on whether I would like to continue in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãCivil Engineering.
    
    I decided to change the subject in college and also joined the University of S√£o Paulo in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPhysics with a focus on education.
     
    At the same time I worked at a school where for a period I was responsible for the Maker Space laboratory. At this point I started some programming courses for Arduinos so that I could work with my students and that's when the desire to return to programming resurfaced.`

    title: 'Being a teacher assistant in a kindergarten in Germany',
    content: `For almost two years I was an assistant teacher at a kindergarten in Germany. This was my first job living outside my home country. This kindergarten was a bilingual concept and I worked as an English language assistant. Here my biggest challenge was learning German to understand my colleagues and my students who understood English but only responded in German.
    I had an extremely happy experience in this environment. The kindergarten had 50 children between 18 months and 6 years old and as it is an international environment, it was a personal immersion for me to live among different cultures, which I believe has enriched me personally.`

    title: 'Working backstage in a Musical Theater in Hamburg',
    content: `Considering the almost a year of absence during the period of isolation due to the Corona Virus, I worked in a theater behind the stage for almost 3 years.
    After my first job in Germany at a kindergarten, although I loved the experience, my focus was on going back to studying German and programming. The fact that my classes were at the same time as kindergarten made me look for a night job.
    I took singing and ballet classes as a child, and acting was something that always fascinated me. I ended up discovering this opportunity to work closely in a theater production in Hamburg - 'Tina Turner Musical' and that had the perfect work schedule so that I could continue with my study plans.
    
    There I worked directly with the actors' costumes and supported the actors in changing clothes and accessories during scene changes during the show. It was a completely different work experience than any I had so far, but it was amazing to meet people from so many different departments, different countries and, of course, it allowed me to continue studying in the mornings and afternoons.`
